This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), the docs for that are in the Create React App Docs section below

## React Redux Firebase Docs

### Run With Example Data

1. Run `yarn install` to install dependencies
1. Run `yarn start`
1. Visit `localhost:3000` to view and add todos (note the todos are shared among everyone)

### Run Your Own

1. Make sure you have Firestore setup within your Firebase console 
1. Run `yarn install` to install dependencies
1. Change the config in `src/config/config.js` to match your Firebase instance (from Firebase console)
1. Run `yarn start`
1. Visit `localhost:3000` to view and add todos to your own `todos` collection of Firestore

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
